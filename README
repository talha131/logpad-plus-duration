logpad.vim emulates Windows Notepad's logging feature.

Create a new file, write .LOG as the first line and save it. Every time you reopen the file, a new line with the current timestamp is added, so you can easily maintain a chronologic log of your tasks.

By default, this plugin works the same way as the original Notepad. You can modify certain aspects of it by setting the following variables:

let LogpadEnabled = [ 0 / 1 ]
* enables/disables logpad
* default value: 1

let LogpadInsert = [ 0 / 1 ]
* automatically enables &insertmode when a new log entry is created
* default value: 0

let LogpadLineBreak = [ 0 / 1 ]
* adds an empty line before a new log entry
* default value: 0 (Windows Notepad behavior)

let LogpadIgnoreNotes = [ 0 / 1 ]
* allows adding notes before the first log entry
* default value: 0

let LogpadIgnoreReadOnly = [ 0 / 1 ]
* allows logpad to ignore a file's read-only flag
* default value: 0
